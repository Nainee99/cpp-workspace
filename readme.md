## 💻 Examples

Here’s a brief example demonstrating how to declare and use a simple class in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Rectangle {
public:
    int width, height;

    Rectangle(int w, int h) {
        width = w;
        height = h;
    }

    int area() {
        return width * height;
    }
};

int main() {
    Rectangle rect(5, 10);
    std::cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << rect.area() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### 📝 Practice Problem

**Problem**: Write a program to implement a stack using an array. Include push and pop operations.
